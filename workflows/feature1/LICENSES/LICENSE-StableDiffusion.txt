CreativeML Open RAIL-M License
dated August 22, 2022

Section I: PREAMBLE

Multimodal generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the
potential to transform the way artists, among other individuals, parsing and
creating content. These AI-based tools may solve the problems of many individuals
and at the same time, they raise potential risks that must be evaluated. In order
to help the AI community develop AI technologies and models responsibly, BigScience
has developed an initial set of guidelines to release its models in a responsible
manner.

This license strives to both enable free and open access to a large multimodal
model, while not allowing uses of the model that may harm individuals and
society. It is also designed to enable broad access for research purposes while
making explicit that such access does not include rights to commercial use
without further agreement with the company, and that commercial users may be
subject to additional restrictions.

Section II: DEFINITIONS

1. "License" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
Distribution as defined in this document.

2. "Data" means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the
dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate
the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.

3. "Output" means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational
content resulting therefrom.

4. "Model" means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including
checkpoints), consisting of learned weights, parameters (including optimizer
states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the
Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on
the Data, using the Complementary Material.

5. "Derivatives of the Model" means all modifications to the Model, works based
on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of
patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the
other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model,
including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of
intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of
synthetic data by the Model for training the other model.

6. "Complementary Material" means the accompanying source code and scripts used
to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data
for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation,
tutorials, examples, etc, if any.

7. "Distribution" means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other
sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including
providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other
remote means - e.g. API-based or web access.

8. "Licensor" means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
owner that is granting the License, including the persons or entities that may
have rights in the Model and/or distributing the Model.

9. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and
in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application -
e.g. chatbot, translator, image generator.

10. "Third Parties" means individuals or legal entities that are not under
common control with Licensor or You.

11. "Contribution" means any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Model and any modifications or additions to the Model or Derivatives of
the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted to the Licensor for inclusion
in the Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity
authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

12. "Contributor" means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
within the Model.

Section III: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model
and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject
to additional terms as described in Section IV.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.

2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License
and where and as applicable, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Model to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or
Complementary Material or a Contribution incorporated within the Model and/or
Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or
Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Section IV: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION

3. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access
purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the
Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:
a. Use-based restrictions as referenced in paragraph 5 MUST be included as an
   enforceable provision by You in any type of legal agreement (e.g. a license)
   governing the use and/or distribution of the Model or Derivatives of the
   Model, and You shall give notice to subsequent users You Distribute to, that
   the Model or Derivatives of the Model are subject to paragraph 5.
b. You must give any Third Party recipients of the Model or Derivatives of the
   Model a copy of this License;
c. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
   changed the files;
d. You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Model,
   Derivatives of the Model.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
Distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivatives of the Model as
a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and Distribution of the Model
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

4. Use-based restrictions. The restrictions set forth in Attachment A are
considered Use-based restrictions. Therefore You cannot use the Model and the
Derivatives of the Model for the specified restricted uses. You may use the
Model subject to this License, including only for lawful purposes and in
accordance with the License. Use of the Model is subject to the following
conditions:
