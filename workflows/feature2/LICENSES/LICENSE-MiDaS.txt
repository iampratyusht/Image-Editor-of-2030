MiDaS - Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation
Copyright (c) 2019-2023 Intel ISL

Project URL: https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS

Paper: "Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for 
        Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer"
Authors: René Ranftl, Katrin Lasinger, David Hafner, Konrad Schindler, 
         Vladlen Koltun

Paper URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341

Models used in this project:
- MiDaS_small (DPT-Hybrid lightweight variant)
  Optimized for fast inference on CPU/edge devices
  Input: RGB image (any resolution)
  Output: Inverse depth map

The MiDaS model is loaded via PyTorch Hub:
  torch.hub.load("intel-isl/MiDaS", "MiDaS_small")

ADDITIONAL NOTICES:

This project uses MiDaS for monocular depth estimation to:
1. Generate depth maps from single RGB images
2. Compute surface normals for physics-based relighting
3. Provide geometric priors for the neural relighting network

The depth estimation enables realistic lighting effects by understanding
the 3D structure of the scene from a 2D image.
